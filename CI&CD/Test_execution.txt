1.Run test cases using pom.xml file
before we used only for depandancy now we are going to use pom.xml to run testng.xml  will execute test cases
In pom.xml file there are two type of entrys one is defandancy entry and onther is plugin we need to add compiler plugin and another one is surefire plugin to run test cases 
from pom.xml file
After property tags in pom.xml we need to add the tag <build></build> inside that we need to add <plugins></plugins> inside that we need to add plugin which was downloaded 
from google
now update the project from maven option or use AIT+F5
To execute the pom.xml file right click on the file and click run as then click on maven test this will start executing


2.run test cases thorugh  Maven CLI
to do this we need maven in our windows
 i.How to install and configure zip file
  download from google and extract the zip file, put in direct after C directory and configure environment variable. copy the path till bin folder
  in path variable past the copied path. if its installed open the cmd and type mvn -- version  if it gives the version maven as been installed properly

  take the project current location and naviagete to the location in CMD 
  and give mvn clean install 
  
  instead of give above codes manually we can use bat file to execute thos

Create run.bat file inside project
copy this code in bat fie
 cd C:\location
 mvn clean install
