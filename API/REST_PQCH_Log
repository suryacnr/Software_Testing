Session 3
1.path &quary parameter

we can define the path and parameters in dynamically instead of hardcording because we can recuse the same code in some other scripts


@Test
void testpathparamAndQuaryparam(){
	given()
	//https://toolsqa.com/search?keyword=tool
	//we can define the path  parameter in given() method use .pathParam()
      .pathParam("req","Search") //we can define them by key and value. key can be userdined were value must be "serach" from the above url
      //question do i need to use only search or if there is any other path  specified before the search do i need to include that to
      //yes you denfine if there is one path before the search you can define in pathParam()

      //we can defineby quary parameter in the given() method use .quaryParam()
      .quaryParam("keyword","tool") //if the value is in int we dont need to give double quotes to value in QP
      //we can define one or more paramether by adding extra .quaryParma()


	.when()
	 .get("https://toolsqa.com/{{req}}") //we dont need to define quaryparam in the url but we need to define path param in the url QP will be automatically taken in runtime 

	.then()
      .statusCode()
      .log.all();

}


2.Cookies
  we need first check what all the cookies are creating


      given()

      .when()
          .get("url")
      .then()
          .log().all();    


 Now we check the cookie in then() method
        

           given()

      .when()
          .get("url")
      .then()
          .cookie("key","value") //you define the cookie and is value to check the codition. we can add how much condition or cookies we can't
          .log().all(); 

Store the key information in varaiable
      Response res=  given()

      .when()
          .get("url") //you can store all the resposnse in the varaiable of given() method
       //get signel cookie info
      String cookie_value=res.getCookie("Name of the cookie") //key of the cookie should be set here and store them in string
       //get all cookie info
       Map<String,String> cookie_values= res.getCookies();
       // use look statement to print
       Syso(cookie_values.keySet()); //like this you can print all the values of cookies using ValueSet();

       for(String valu:cookie_value.keySet()){
       syso(valu);
       }





3.Header
      we can validate content type or content value or servers etc from the headers

       given()

      .when()
          .get("url")
      .then() //if you have multiple validation we can sperate them by .and() this is option
        .header("content-type","application/json")
        .and()
          .log().all(); 

     //get sigel header info
       Response res=  given()

      .when()
          .get("url")
      String hed=res.getHeader("content-value");
      syso(hed);

      //get all header info
        //get sigel header info
       Response res=  given()

      .when()
          .get("url")
      Headers hed=res.getHeaders("content-value"); //this is not hashmap but still it store value in key and value par
      for(Header he:hed){
      syso(he);
      }


      this may be usefull in advance case but not in all case

      
how many ways we can write log
   for this we have 
       log().all() // this will print all the information of the response such as head,cookie,response,time etc
       log.header() // this will print only header related information in console
       log.body() //which will print only cookies from response


Parsing response data/validation
