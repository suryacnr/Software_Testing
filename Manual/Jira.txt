we will add a story to the sprint than we will start the sprint which will go 2 to 3 weeks time for the story we will have task. for the task 
 dev and testing will write the task and complete the task during that time and close the story

Test management workflow in Jira
after we install the jeff fire plugin within the Jira we have to perform a different activity we can create test case or we can import test
case from excel we can create test cycle and add that particular test case to that test cycle and execute that test cases and if there is
any failer we can report that bug and we will generate that report
