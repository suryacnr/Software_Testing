Test design Techniques/ Test data design techniques/ Test case design 

The test design technique will reduce the data at the same time we should make sure everything is covered with minimal data
test design will reduce the data and it increase the coverage
Reduce the number test cases to be executed

type of test design
1.Equivalence class partition
2. Bountry value analyzation
3. Decision table
4. state transition
5. error guessing

what equivalence class partition?

equivalence class partition is a test design technique 
it divides the data into various class and we can select that data according to that class and test, 
that will reduce the number of test cases to be executed and save time for testing

what is boundary value analysis?

is a test design technique it manly focus on the boundary of the value eg if we have 18 is minium and 35 is maximum we will check with 
- and + numbers it will reduce the number of test cases to be executed and save the time 

Input domain testing 
the values will be verified in the text box/input field
here ECP & BVA  techiques

what decision table?
decision table is also called as a cause-effect table
this technique will be used if we have more "conditions" and corresponding "action"
we deal with combination of input


Based on the condition action will be performed 

what is a state transition? 
changing the state from one condition to another

it allows the tester to test the behavior of an AUT
