1.what is the test plan?
the test plan is a document that describes the test scope, test strategies objective, schedule, deliverables and resources required to perform
testing for software product

test scope means what to test and what not to test

test strategies what kind of testing first smoke testing, sanity testing, regression testing, and functional testing

Roles and responsibility  will be clearly defined test engineer, test lead and project managers who is the author of document and who will 
review it

test schedules mean when we have to contact what kind of testing clearly we have to mention what kind of testing and the date

test deliverables each and every phase of testing we are going to deliver some document like test plan, test case, defect report, test 
execution report is one deliverable

pricing document will be done by the management

entry and exit criteria when we have to start the testing and when we have to exit the testing that should be clearly mentioned

suspension and resumption criteria we have to mention we have stopped the testing and when we have to resume the testing

what kind of tool we have to mention them
risk and mitigation
approval who is going to approve the document


2. what is the use case test scenario and test case
Use case
the use case has described the requirements in more diagrammatical representation

use case contains three items (this will not be done by tester this will be done by a Business analyst)
Actor== is a user
action== he will perform the action
Goal/outcome== he will get the outcome

test scenario
A possible area to be tested (what to test)

Test case 
test case is a step by step action to be performed to validate the functionality(how to test)


Test suite
 the test suite is a group of test cases that belongs to the same category
eg: grouping all the test cases which come together as smoke test suite and grouping all the test cases which come together as a 
regression test suite


3. RTM(requirement traceability matrics)
RTM describes the mapping of requirements with test cases.
the main purpose of RTM is to see all the requirements is all the test cases is covered so that no functionality is missed while doing the testing

4. what is a test environment 
is software and hardware environment we have setup the same environment as client environment to test
another name of test environment is test bed

5. Defects/bugs
 Any mismatched functionality found in an application that leads to a defect/bug
Defect reporting Tools:
Jira, TFS

6. Defect Reporting attribute/content
