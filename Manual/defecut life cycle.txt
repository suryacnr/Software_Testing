defecut life cycle

why developer will reject the bug 
enachment
not reproducable
Need more information
As designed


STLC Process
Understanding the requirment
Test design
Test environment and execution
Bug reporting and tracking
Test cycle closuers

when we have to stop testing

critiria 1 when we have 100 test cases and executed all and closed all the bugs than we will stop the testing

test metrics
when ever we are doing some task we have to messure the task so we have to messure because we have to know how much we are in progress
which will help the management team how much work is done what is inprogress and everthing

Requirment data for test metrics
1.No of requirment
2.Avg no of test cases written per requirment
3.Total no of test cases written fo all requirment
4.Total no test cases executed/Total no test cases written)*100
5.No of test cases pass/Total no test cases written)*100
6.No of test cases fail/Total no test cases written)*100
7.No of test cases blocked/Total no test cases written)*100
8.No of test cases un expected/Total no test cases written)*100
9.total no of defects identified
10.critical defecut
11.Higer defecut
12.medium defect
13.low defecut
14.customer defecut
15.No of defecut found in UAT



Defecut metrics

defecut density means no of defecuts identified per requirement
No of defecuts found /Size no requirment

Defecut removal Effciency(DRE)

(A/A+B)*100
(Fixed Defecuts /(Fixed Defecuts+Missed Defecuts))*100

A-Defecuts identified during testing/Fixed Defecuts
B-Defecuts identified by the customer/Missed Defecuts

Defecut lekage
No of Defecuts found in UAT/No of defcuts found in testing)*100

Defecut rejection ration

No of defecuts rejected/Total no of defecuts raised)*100

Defecut age fixed date-Reort date

customer satisfaction =no of complains per period of time
