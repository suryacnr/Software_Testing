7 testing principle

Testing shows the presence of defects in the software==Higly impossible to give the bug free software to the customer
Exhaustive testing is not possible == shold not do exhaustive testing. means every time we should not use same data for testing every time
Early testing == start software at early stages. Means from the beginning when you get the requirments.
Defect clustering== means some modules contains most of the defects out of 100 only 20% contains more defects
Pesticide paradox==means if you are executing the same test cases for longer run they wont find any defects, we have to keep update the test cases in every cycle
Testing is context== means deciding what type of testing should be conducted based on the type of application
Absence of errors fallacy == Test the software in order to find the defects. means should always think about bugs
