Agile model/ agile methodology /agile process

It is an iterative and incremental approach
iterative means the same process we are going to conduct again and again
incremental approach means keep on adding new modules are new feature in existing moduel

Agile principle
customer no need to wait till complete software is developed
we develop, test and release the piece of software to the customer with few number of features.
we can accept/accommodate requirement changes

There will be good communication customer developer tester and BA


Advantages:
requirement changes are allowed in any stages of development (or) we can accommodate requirement changes in the middle of development
Releases will be very fast (weekly)
customer no need to wait for long time
good communication between team
it is a very easy model to adopt.



Disadvantages;
 less focus on design and documentation

difference between agile and scrum
scrum is a framework through which we develop and test the software an build the software product by following agile principles.

Agile is basically defien the princples, how the process should be and to follow the principle. scrum wil help us to follow the principle


scrum
-----------
Scrum team we have product owner, scrum manster, developing team and testing team

Product owner:
 defien the features of the product== he will contact to the customer and take the requirment
 Prioritize features according to the market value
 Adjust features and priority every iteration, as needed
 accept or reject work resuls

Scrum master

  the main role is facilitating and driving the agile process



scrum terminology
User story: A Feature/module in a software (its a smaller requirment)
Epic : is collection of user stores (its a larger requirment)
Product backlog: contains list of user story prepared by product owner
sprint : period of time to complete the user stores, decided by the product owner and team usually 2-4 weeks of time
Sprint planning meeting: meating contacted with a team to define what can we delivered in the sprint and duriation
sprint backlog: list of committed stories by Dev/QA for specific sprint
scrum meetin : meating conducted by the scrum master everyday 15 mins. called as stand up meeting
                what did you do yestarday
                what will you do today
                are there any impediments in your way
sprint retrospective meeting: after completion of every sprint
                              here we will discuse about what went well and what went wrong any other improvment we have to do for upcoming sprint

story point: Rough estimation of user stories, will be given by Dev and QA in the form of fibonacci  series

Burndown chart: shows how much work remaning in the sprint. maintained by the scrum master daily

The Agile scrum framework at a glance

the product owner will get requirment form stakeholders/executives/customer then he will prepare prodcut backlog
Once the prodcut backlog is ready sprint planing meeting will happen 
Sprint backlog which team will be comied than the sprint will start, usual 2 to 4 weeks
every 24 hrs scrum meeting will be conducted by scrum master, based on this meeting he wil prepare burdown chart
After finished work sprint review will happen(in sprint review we will check all the bugs are closed or not and all test cases are executed
We will give to demo to product owner once accepted it delivered to owner than we will have sprint retrospetive
